My work is exhibited nationally and internationally.  I share my love of creativity and the arts through workshops with other artists, the elderly and those in health care.  My work as Artist-in-Residence in various nursing homes led me to create a wellness program that reaches the hearts and souls of residents through the arts: visual, performance, and creative writing.  My interest and dedication led to a Master’s degree in Fine Arts and Medicine.  Several of my MFA projects embraced people from all walks of life and encouraged others to be involved in my journey of healing.  </p>
<p>In my studio I work with beads, buttons, fiber photo imaging, and other embellishment, to create stitched fabric collage that tells a story. My work is included in the collections of the National Institutes of Health, Kaiser Permanente, The Children's Inn, The Greater Hospital of Baltimore, G Street Fabrics, the State Department’s Art in Embassies program, and other private and corporate collections. </p>
<p>My eclectic background includes over twenty years as a studio artist. I spent many years developing programs for staff and residents in nursing facilities, and five years as the Executive Director of Rockville Arts Place in Rockville, MD.  My career began as a teacher of art, English, and mathematics in Maryland’s Montgomery County high schools. </p>
