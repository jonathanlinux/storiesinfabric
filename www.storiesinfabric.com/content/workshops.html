  <div class="content"><p>The emphasis of my classes is on process rather than product.   They are designed to promote random play and experimentation while leaving censure at the door. Unless specified the classes are full day but can be tailored to fit the needs of a group or organization.  Several can be combined for a unified three to five day retreat. There is also a series of in-house classes and lectures designed for health care staff on Art and Healing.  Feel free to <a href="../contact.html" title="Contact Me">contact me</a> with your individual needs. </p>
<p><strong>Awaken Creativity</strong> - Experience random play with a wide variety of art media and techniques. Experiment with pastes, paints, texture, block printing, and various other media on fabric and paper.  We’ll amass stacks of papers and fabrics to incorporate into your own art.</p>
<p><strong>Awaken Creativity #2</strong> – Leave censure at the door.  Continue play with a variety of art media and techniques.  Explore foiling, grunge board, scrim, stenciling, layering, TAP, and much more.  End the day with a book that highlights your experimental play. </p>
<p><strong>Color to Dye For</strong> - Play with dyes.  Mix outrageous colors or choose a select few. We’ll experiment with resists, texture, paste, folded dye techniques, and more to create patterns on natural fabrics.  Everyone takes home silk scarves and stacks of samples. </p>
<p><strong>Kidnapped </strong> - Bring your much-loved sayings, quotes, bits of poetry, and/or favorite words to class. Working with Timtex, develop a stand-alone art fragment or book using these particular words. Learn to integrate your words ransom note style or choose from a variety of other techniques to deliver your personal message. </p>
<p><strong>Memory Book/Create with Lazertran Silk</strong> - Do you have ties and other specialty fabrics languishing in your stash?  Bring a selection to class with you.  Students create an art book combining specialty fabrics with images, words, and other ephemera.  Experiment with transferring images onto wood, metal and silk using the Lazertran process.  Images provided by the instructor.</p>
<p><strong>Simply Spectacular Books </strong>– Learn the secrets by making four or more simple but spectacular books to showcase special events in your life. Create abbreviated versions of the same books to send as greetings to a special friend. </p>
<p><strong>Simply Spectacular Books #2</strong> – Learn the secrets by making more spectacular but simple books to showcase special events in your life. Create abbreviated versions of these same books as greetings cards for special friends. Insert words to make your creation one of a kind.</p>
<p><strong>The Storyteller</strong> - Celebrate a memory or create your own fantasy with a book fashioned from textiles and paper. Use bits and pieces of favorite fabrics, laces, fragments of ribbon, buttons, and beads, anything that completes your story.  In this class we’ll experiment using the ephemera you bring combined with paint and other textures to commemorate a special event or time in your life.</p>
<p><strong>The Houston Quilt Festival 2008</strong> was again a grand event for artists and quilters.  In the photos below my students are experimenting with papers, paints, dyes, and other materials.  My classes this year were Awaken Creativity, Simply Spectacular Books, Color to Dye For, and Possibilities of Lazertran Silk.  (picture not available)<br />
